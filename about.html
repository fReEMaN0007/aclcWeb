                    <p>  <span style="float: left; width: 0.8em; font-size: 290%; font-family: serif; line-height: 80%;">T</span>he AMA Group of Companies was built upon the dream of the late Amable M. Aguiluz Sr. (AMA), Auditor General and National Treasurer during the term of President Diosdado Macapagal, to build an institurion that would provide world-class educaiton to Filipino youth.</p>
                    <p>That dream bore fruit on October 20, 1980 when his son, Dr. Amable R. Aguiluz V (ARA), established the AMA Institute of Computer Studies and blazed along Shaw Boulevard, the pioneering school offered EDP Fundamentals, Basic Programming and Techology Career courses.</p>
                    <p>In June 1981, AMA Computer College (AMACC) was launched offering a four-year degree course in BS Computer Science - the first to be offered in the country. From only 13 students, the population of AMACC surged to 600 in 1983 and to 2,000 in 1985. To meet the growing demand for computer courses, AMACC established its first campus in Makati in 1983. A second campus followed in 1986 in Project 8, Quezon City.</p>
                    <p>In 1987, AMA Computer Learning Center (ACLC) was established to offer short courses in computer programming and two-year technical vocational courses. Today, there are more than 100 learning centers nationwide.</p>
                    <p>In the same year, AMA Basic Education was formed to offer elementary, highschoool and eventually pre-school education. Now known as the St. Augustine International Scool, its branches are located in Metro Manila, Laguna, Cebu, and Davao.</p>
                    <p>In 1996, AMA set up the AMA Telecommunications and Electronics Learning Center (AMATEL) - the country's first-ever telecommunications school. It is now called AMA International Institute of Technology(AIIT)</p>
                    <p>In 1998, ABE International Business was established to offer courses in Hotel and Restaurant Management(HRM), Business Administration and computer-related courses. today, ABE has several branches nationwide, ABE is an international school affiliated with ABE in the United Kingdom. It offers not just local, but also international diploma and international practicum program.</p>
                    <p>The AMA school network also expanded overseas with branches in Los Angeles, California; Manama, Bahrain; Bangladesh; China; and Hong Kong. In 2000, AMAES launched its most ambitious expansion program with no less than 14 branches being set up nationwide. To help its graduates find employment, AMA established in the same year its own manpower placement agency called INFOTECH Professional Services Inc.</p>
                    <p>The year 2002 saw AMA expanding into maritime education, medicine, nursing, care-giving and allied health courses. Now, the Norwegian Maritime Academy(NMA), the AMA School of Medicine (ASM), and the St. Augustine School of Nursing(SASN) are making a mark in their respective fields with their IT-based curricula.</p>
                    <p> AMA Education System (AMAES) - the umbrella for AMA schools, currently boasts of more than 200 campuses nationwide and in key foreign cities. It has proudly produced more than 150,000 professionals who have been gainfully employed locally and overseas.</p>
                    <p>On August 20, 2002, AMA was granted University status by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) - a well-earned tribute to the first ISO-certificated computer educational institution in the Philippines. Founding Chairman Dr. Amable R. Aguiluz V was installed as the first AMA University president.</p>
